## [0.14.0] - 2025-07-09

> [!NOTE]
> Many features are now hidden behind the `Advanced Mode`. Be sure to check that if you are missing anything!

### Added
- A new global option named `Advanced Mode`, defaulting to off, that is used to hide a bunch of advanced options. Note that this only hides options, it does not reset any options to defaults.
- Two popups for editing, adding, and removing paper and card sizes have been added.
- In the preview you can now sort cards via drag-n-drop. The alphabetical order can also be restored with a button on top of the preview.
- After generating previews the user will now be notified of images that have bad aspect ratios and will thus lead to distorted images in the final output.

### Changed
- Maximum values for margins are now more sensible in `Full` and `Linked` control.
- Cards are now always centered within the available margins.
- Browsing for images with native file dialogs has been replaced with a dedicated dialog in order to avoid confusion when users selected images outside of their images folder.

### Fixed
- In `Full` margins control, when reaching margins so tight that only one card fits the opposing margins will be moved to always allow a full card.
- The cards border appears again in the preview when the `Export Exact Guides` option is enabled.
- Extended guides are now positioned correctly with assymmetric margins.
- Exported exact guides are now correct again with assymmetric margins.
- The options are is now sized correctly to avoid vertical scrolling on initial startup.
- Combo boxes and spin boxes inside the options area now consume mouse wheel input when focused, aka selected by the user.
- Shortly flickering windows that could appear on startup and in some rare corner cases no longer appear.
- The default `Poker` card size has been fixed to have correct units.

## [0.13.0] - 2025-19-08

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check the changelog as this version has some important changes!

### Added
- New options to control margins were added:
    - `Auto`: Automatically compute the margins to be as small as possible.
    - `Simple`: Allow changing top-left margins only, giving the option to offset the cards.
    - `Full`: Gives control over all margins, allowing to offset the cards and also reduce the amount of cards on the page.
    - `Linked`: Gives control over a single value and forces all margins to be that value. Useful for example when working with setups where specifications require specific margins.
- When any option other than `Auto` is chosen for  margins the final margins are now visible in the print preview.
- The option `Card Orientation` is now available to allow for more layout control:
    - `Vertical`: Same as before, cards will be upright.
    - `Horizontal`: Cards are rotated by 90 degrees.
    - `Mixed`: First fill out as much as possible with vertical cards, then try to fill the rest of the space with horizontal cards.

### Changed
- Users should now place all images, with or without bleed edge, into the images folder. The app should then use the available information to determine whether the image has bleed edge or not.
- The MtG decklist downloader will now automatically change the relevant settings instead of warning the user of invalid settings.
- When downloading cards via the MtG decklist downloader the respective card backs will also be automatically downloaded and assigned to each card.

### Removed
- The `Allow Precropped` setting is no longer needed and has been removed.

### Fixed
- The MtG decklist downloader will no longer fail downloading cards with non-numeric collector numbers.
- The card size `Standard x2` is now treated as a valid option for the MtG decklist downloader.
- Extended guides are now rendered the same in the preview and the rendered pdf.
- A rare crash during shutdown was fixed.
- Folders are now always treated as absolute, which should fix issues with using image folders on other drives.
- The `Rounded` card corners option now also works when exporting pdf files with embedded jpg files.

### Contributors
- Big props to @ahernandezjr for contributing the code for margin control.
